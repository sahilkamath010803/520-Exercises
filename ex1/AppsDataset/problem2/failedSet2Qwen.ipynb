Let's define:\n","\n","- `cnt1 = count of \"(( \"` → adds two open brackets\n","- `cnt2 = count of \"()\"` → one open, one close\n","- `cnt3 = count of \")( \"` → one close, one open\n","- `cnt4 = count of \")) \"` → two close brackets\n","\n","Now, when we combine all these strings:\n","\n","- The **total length** of the final string is `2 * total = 2 * (cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4)`, which must be even for a regular sequence, so `total` must be even. If `total` is not even, it's **impossible** to form a regular sequence.\n","\n","Next, we need to ensure the **balance of parentheses** after any order of strings:\n","\n","Let’s define:\n","- `open_contribution` = how many extra open brackets we have overall.\n","- `close_contribution` = how many extra close brackets we have overall.\n","\n","Each string contributes:\n","\n","- `((`: +2 open\n","- `()`: balance is 0\n","- `)(`: +1 close, +1 open = total 0, net change +1 close\n","- `))`: +2 close\n","\n","So to calculate the **net contribution** to balance:\n","\n","`open_contribution = 2 * cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3`  \n","`close_contribution = cnt2 + 2 * cnt4 + cnt3`\n","\n","In total, the sum of open and close brackets must be equal for a regular bracket sequence.

Let's define:\n","\n","- `cnt1 = count of \"(( \"` → adds two open brackets\n","- `cnt2 = count of \"()\"` → one open, one close\n","- `cnt3 = count of \")( \"` → one close, one open\n","- `cnt4 = count of \")) \"` → two close brackets\n","\n","Now, when we combine all these strings:\n","\n","- The **total length** of the final string is `2 * total = 2 * (cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4)`, which must be even for a regular sequence, so `total` must be even. If `total` is not even, it's **impossible** to form a regular sequence.\n","\n","Next, we need to ensure the **balance of parentheses** after any order of strings:\n","\n","Let’s define:\n","- `open_contribution` = how many extra open brackets we have overall.\n","- `close_contribution` = how many extra close brackets we have overall.\n","\n","Each string contributes:\n","\n","- `((`: +2 open\n","- `()`: balance is 0\n","- `)(`: +1 close, +1 open = total 0, net change +1 close\n","- `))`: +2 close\n","\n","So to calculate the **net contribution** to balance:\n","\n","`open_contribution = 2 * cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3`\n","`close_contribution = cnt2 + 2 * cnt4 + cnt3`\n","\n","In total, the sum of open and close brackets must be equal for a regular bracket sequence.
